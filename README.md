# install or build

Binary releases for linux, windows, and darwin are available for v0.6.7+. You can install
from source on these systems by running:

`go get -u -t github.com/as/a`

If you want to install a prior version (v0.5.5, for example, which uses the original exp/shiny)

```
go get github.com/as/a
go get github.com/golang/vgo
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/as/a
git checkout v0.5.5-release 
vgo build
```

You can also build the latest with vgo, but vgo is not necessary for that

```
git checkout master
vgo build
```
